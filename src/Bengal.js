    <h3>WHAT IS A BENGAL CAT?</h3>
    <p>
      The Bengal cat is a long, muscular, medium- to large-sized cat, with a
      broad head and muzzle, high cheekbones, and pronounced whisker pads. The
      eyes are round and wide, with dark markings around the eyes (mascara) and
      the ears small and rounded at the tips. The grace of a jungle cat is held
      as one of the positive characteristics, along with the ability to move
      quietly and with stealth. The back legs are slightly longer than the front
      legs, making the hind end a bit higher than the shoulders, and emphasizing
      the Bengal's wild-cat appearance. The Bengal's muscular, athletic build is
      one of its most defining features; it is never delicate. The Bengal stands
      out among cats for its lush, dense, and remarkably soft coat. The
      distinctive leopard-like spots on the Bengal house cat can be random,
      aligned horizontally with rosettes that form a half circle, or in a
      marbled pattern. The preferred colors are black or brown spotted, and
      black or brown marbled, but breeders have also engineered Bengals that are
      snow spotted (white), and snow marbled. The spots should be in sharp
      contrast to the background color. Bengals often possess a trait called
      glittering, which makes the coat appear to have been dusted with gold or
      pearl. While this naturally occurring trait enhances the natural beauty of
      the Bengal, and is preferred by some people, it it not given special
      preference in the show ring.

    <h3>BENGAL CAT PERSONALITY AND TEMPERAMENT</h3>
    <p>
      Because of its feral lineage, the Bengal is often assumed to be difficult
      to handle, but the reverse is true. Breeders insist that the Bengal can be
      tamed easily and has an affectionate personality, though it is not a lap
      cat. However, it does enjoy human company, and will often stay close to
      its family members. The Bengal cat breed particularly enjoys the company
      of children, since its energetic nature makes it very fond of playing
      games. One of the traits the Bengal house cat retains from its wild
      ancestry is the hunting instinct -- not only for small land animals, but
      also for water dwelling creatures. The Asian leopard has honed the ability
      to fish in the wild, and your domestic Bengal may very well carry this
      trait in the more playful form, swimming along side of you, taking a
      shower or bath, or just playing in the sink. A high energy cat, you will
      want to be sure to give your Bengal plenty of play time, and keep in mind
      that most high energy cats like to jump to high locations. You will want
      to keep breakable objects out of harms way and off of open shelves; even,
      and perhaps especially, the highest shelves.

    <h3>HISTORY AND BACKGROUND</h3>
    <p>
      The Bengal cat breed is singular in the cat fancy as the only successful
      pairing of a wild cat with a domestic cat. There is some anecdotal
      evidence that pairings of the Asian leopard cat with domestic cats had
      been attempted prior to the 1960s, but the real genesis of the Bengal
      breed began in earnest in the 1970s, when amateur breeder Jean Sudgen, of
      California, became the recipient of a group of cats that had been bred for
      use in genetic testing. Dr. Willard Centerwall of Loyola University had
      been testing Asian Leopards for their partial immunity to feline leukemia,
      and began cross breeding them with domestic cats for possible genetic
      viability in immunization development. Rather than destroy the cats after
      the program was completed, Dr. Centerwall searched for appropriate homes
      for his cats. Because Ms. Sudgen had an actual interest in breeding Asian
      leopard hybrids, she chose not to take all of the cats, instead focusing
      on those cats that were showing a predilection for domestic temperament
      along with the desired spotting patterns. For her part, Ms. Sudgen had
      begun her first experiments in cat hybridization while studying genetics
      at UC Davis in the 1940s. When presented with the opportunity to work with
      Dr. Centerwall's Asian leopards and their hybrids, she took to it with
      enthusiasm, and although Dr. Centerwall was fully supportive of Ms.
      Sudgen's endeavors, the same could not be said for the cat fancy
      community. Most breeders were staunchly against breeding a wild cat with a
      domestic, and to this day, the Cat Fanciers Association continues to
      refuse registration to the Bengal because of its wild bloodline, though
      many other associations have included the Bengal breed since the 1980s,
      including The International Cat Association. Ms. Sudgen, who had by now
      remarried and taken the name Mill, had been cautioned that the offspring
      of her crossings would be sterile, and this did prove true for the males
      that resulted from the matings, but she had better luck with the female
      hybrids. Before she could fully immerse herself in her new breeding
      program, however, Ms. Mill needed an appropriate male cat to cross with
      her female Asian leopard hybrids. Feeling that neither the Mau, Burmese,
      or Abyssinian pure breeds were genetically strong enough, she opened her
      net wider, and in 1982, her patience paid off when a curator for the New
      Delhi Zoo, in India, pointed her to a leopard-like street cat that was
      living on its own in the rhinoceros' exhibit at the zoo. Although the cat
      was feral, it proved to be an excellent mate for her hybrid females, and
      within years Ms. Mill had her successful, though still fledgling, breeding
      program well underway. The first three generations, from the original
      pairing of an Asian leopard hybrid to a domestic, until the birthing of
      the fourth generation, are considered to be the “foundation" cats
      (generations are technically referred to as F1, F2, F3, F4...and so on).
      While these F1-F3 cats are considered by their breeders to be safe and
      suitable as pets, they are not allowed into competition. They are simply
      the foundation upon which the "healthy" purebred Bengal is built. By the
      fourth generation, only Bengal to Bengal pairings are allowed, and the cat
      is then considered to be a pure breed. The Asian leopard is
      characteristically a reclusive, solitary, omnivorous hunter, and these
      wilder traits need to be bred out so that the final outcome is a house and
      people friendly feline companion. Early generation Bengal cats are petted
      out to cat fanciers who are up to the challenge of raising a cat that is
      not entirely socialized, but with conscientious breeding, once the Bengal
      has reached the fourth generation stage, the breed exceeds expectations in
      friendliness, affection, and gentility, and has been the recipient of
      numerous show awards. Still, reticence toward the breed persists in some
      circles. As breed originator Jean Mill has said regarding her beloved
      cats, “Any other cat can bite a judge and excuses are made ... but if a
      Bengal bites they claim it's the wild blood. Our Bengals must be the
      sweetest cats at the cat show.”
