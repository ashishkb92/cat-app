    <h3>PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h3>
    <p>
      The American Bobtail cat is fairly long and well built. Their hind legs
      are slightly longer than their forelegs, a feature they share with
      Bobcats. It wears a rain-resistant, all-weather double coat. The American
      Bobtail has a wild appearance, with slightly almond-shaped, "hunter" eyes.
      And the cat's most defining feature is its short tail, which is between
      one-third and one-half the length of an average cat's tail. Though the
      cat's tail is typically straight, it may curve, have a bump or be slightly
      knotted.

    <h3>PERSONALITY AND TEMPERAMENT</h3>
    <p>
      The Bobtail is an intelligent, active and affectionate cat. It loves to
      sit on your lap and be petted; it is often compared to a dog in its
      behavior and devotion. The Bobtail is also great with children, loves to
      play games, and is the type of cat that will meet you at the door when you
      arrive home. An excellent problem solver, it has also been known to escape
      from closed rooms and locked cages.

    <h3>HISTORY AND BACKGROUND</h3>
    <p>
      While not new to America -- first appeared here in the 1960s -- the
      American Bobtail breed has recently become popular. And although the true
      history of this cat is not known, it is widely believed that the breed
      came into being from a mating between a short-tailed brown tabby male
      named Yodie and a seal point Siamese female. Yodie came into the
      possession of John and Blenda Sanders of Iowa while they were enjoying a
      vacation near an Indian reservation in Arizona. Though the ancestry of
      Yodie is not known, he had a short tail. Birman, Himalayan, and a
      Himalayan/Siamese cross were then added to the bloodline. In the 1970s,
      the first standard for this cat was written by Mindy Schultz, a Bobtail
      breeder and friend of the Sanders. But due to the lack of resources, this
      breed made little headway. Unfortunately, most of these early bloodlines
      have now faded out. Then, in the 1980s, a few breeders decided to make a
      slightly more flexible Bobtail. They broke away from the original
      blueprint, which was essentially a short-tailed pointed longhair with
      white mittens and a white face blaze, and began a new breeding program.

    <p>
      This new Bobtail, which has emerged as a result of the efforts of these
      breeders, comes in all colors, categories, and divisions. Its seeds can be
      traced to a Florida breeder, who crossed domestic cats with Bobcats. Doubt
      remains about the authenticity of this story, however, as many experts
      said that such a mating would produce sterile kittens. Another, more
      likely, story is that this short-tailed cat was a product of a naturally
      occurring mutation among domestic cats. The breed has excelled in its
      category but is still in the developing stage.
