      The Bombay breed is perfect for cat-lovers who secretly want to own an
      affectionate panther. Copper-eyed, black and short-haired, this cat has
      the exotic appearance of a tiny, black leopard. In fact, the breed derives
      its name from the Indian city of Bombay, which is also considered the land
      of the black leopard.

    <h3>PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h3>
    <p>
      Curiously, this well-built, medium-sized cat looks rather mundane as a
      kitten. The Bombay does not develop its lustrous, satin-like black coat,
      stunning gold eyes, and other exotic characteristics until after the
      fourth month.

    <h3>PERSONALITY AND TEMPERAMENT</h3>
    <p>
      Bombay cats get along well with children and prefer to be around humans.
      In fact, not only will it display affection and attach itself to one
      particular member of the family, but to all members. However, it will only
      call for attention in a gentle and polite way, without being troublesome.
      This intelligent cat also enjoys playing and exploring.

    <h3>HISTORY AND BACKGROUND</h3>
    <p>
      The late Nikki Horner, an American breeder, is credited for creating the
      first Bombay in the late '50s. Her objective was to breed a cat which
      looked like a miniature panther, with a glossy black coat and yellow eyes.
      However, she wanted the cat to have certain characteristics of the
      Burmese. Although her first attempt at crossing Burmese cats with black
      American Shorthairs were unsuccessful, she continued to persevere.
      Eventually Horner succeeded when she crossed a black American Shorthair
      male, endowed with rich eye color, with a champion Burmese. To her dismay,
      Horner found that the various Cat Associations showed reluctance in
      accepting her creation, and was denied Championship status. But Homer
      persisted in her efforts and in 1976 the cat was finally registered by the
      Cat Fancier's Association. After almost 18 years of struggle, the breed
      was allowed to compete in the Championship Classes on May 1, 1986. Though
      this breed is not easily available, the Bombay has found favor with many
      people and has a steady fan following.
