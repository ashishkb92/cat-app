      Except for the point coloration and blue eyes, the Himalayan is quite
      similar to the Persian. In fact, it is sometimes referred to as a
      "Colorpoint Persian." It derives its name from the Himalayan rabbit, which
      possesses the same colorpoint. The most recognizable Himalayan, at least
      recently, has been "Mr. Jinx," the toilet-flushing cat in the comedy film
      Meet the Parents.

    <h3>PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS</h3>
    <p>
      This is a medium- to large-sized cat with heavy bones, a well-knit body,
      and a short tail. It possesses short legs and a long, thick, glossy coat.
      The Himalayan's most striking features, however, are its broad head and
      large, round, vivid-blue eyes. There are two facial types for the
      Himalayan: extreme and traditional. Although the current show trend is
      toward a more extreme facial type, cats of this type are more prone to
      health problems. As such, the TCA (Traditional Cat Association) advises
      pet owners to only acquire traditional or "Doll-faced" Himalayan cats.

    <h3>PERSONALITY AND TEMPERAMENT</h3>
    <p>
      The Himalayan is an ideal indoor companion; it speaks more and is more
      active than the Persian, but is quieter than the Siamese. Though gentle
      and peace-loving, the Himalayan loves playing games such as fetch and
      getting into mischief, though it can be kept amused by simplest toy or
      even a piece of paper. In addition, a Himalayan can become extremely
      attached to its owner, demanding constant attention and pampering.

    <h3>HISTORY AND BACKGROUND</h3>
    <p>
      The origin of the Himalayan can be traced to the 1920s and '30s, when
      breeders in several countries attempted to produce a cat with a typical
      Persian body, but with Siamese markings. The first signs of success were
      seen in the U.S. in 1924, when White Persians were crossed with Siamese,
      resulting in "Malayan Persians"; and in Sweden, when Dr. T. Tjebbes, a
      geneticist, produced Persian/Siamese crosses. In 1930, Dr. Clyde Keeler of
      Harvard University and Virginia Cobb also began a breeding program in
      order to ascertain how certain traits could be inherited. The first litter
      of black, short-haired kittens was produced by crossing a Siamese fem ale
      with a black Persian male. A black Persian female mated with a Siamese
      male produced a similar result. Encouraged their experiments, Dr. Keeler
      and Cobb crossed a female of the second litter with a male from the first.
      The end product was "Debutante," the first true Himalayan kitten (however,
      it bore more resemblance to the modern Balinese cat than the Himalayan we
      see today). After World War II, an American breeder by the name of
      Marguerita Goforth succeeded in creating the long-awaited Persian-like
      colorpoint. It was officially recognized as a new breed by the Cat
      Fanciers' Association (CFA) and American Cat Fanciers' Association in
      1957. In 1984, in a move that surprised many breeders, the CFA united the
      Persian and Himalayan breed, claiming they had similar body types. Even
      today, some cat organizations do not give this breed its own separate
      name. However, the breed now has Championship status in all associations
      (as the Himalayan or Persian) and was the most popular breed in 1996,
      according to CFA statistics (which include Persians).
